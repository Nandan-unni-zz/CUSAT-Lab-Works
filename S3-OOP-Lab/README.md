# S3 Object Oriented Programming Lab
Solutions to the III Semester OOP Lab Programs, 2019 Scheme <br /><br />

**1.** A phone number, such as (212) 767-8900, can be thought of as having three parts: the area code (212), the exchange (767), and the number (8900). Write a C++ program that uses a structure to store these three parts of a phone number separately. Call the structure phone. Create two structure variables of type phone. Initialize one, and have the user input a number for the other one. Then display both numbers.<br /><br />

**2.** Define a class Date that contains details like year, month and date. Write a C++ program to check the validity of the date that you enter and display the next date.<br /><br />

**3.** Define a class to represent a bank account. Include members like name of depositor, account  no, Type of account, balance amount in the account. Write C++ program with member functions to a) Assign initial values b) To deposit an account c) To withdraw an amount after checking the balance d) To display name and balance <br /><br />

**4.** Write a class which represents the shape triangle. The member functions should a) Check the validity of the triangle b) display the sides c) find the area and display it.<br /><br />

**5.** Write  class which contains an integer array and a static function to find the average of that array. Create THREE objects. Read the values into the array using one object, and find the average. Let the second object modifies the value by multiplying each element by a certain multiplier. Repeat the process of finding the average usng first object. <br /><br />

**6.** Write a program to find shortest distance between three coordinates points, representing vertices of a triangle, using inline function. <br /><br />

**7.** Write a function called swap() that interchanges two int values 	belonging to an object, passed as parameter to it by the calling program. Write a C++ program to demonstrate call by value, call by reference and call by address. <br /><br />

**8.** Write a function called power() that takes a double value for n and an int value for p, and returns the result as a double value. Create a series of overloaded functions with the same name that, in addition to double, also work with types char, int, long, and float. Write a main() program that exercises these overloaded functions with all argument types. <br /><br />
